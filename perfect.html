<h1>Online Microgrid Energy Generation Scheduling with Accurate Prediction</h1>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>  Online decision-making in the presence of uncertain
future information is abundant in many problem domains. In the
critical problem of energy generation scheduling for microgrids,
one needs to decide when to switch energy supply between
a cheaper local generator with startup cost and the costlier
on-demand external grid, considering intermittent renewable
generation and fluctuating demands. Without knowledge of
future input, competitive online algorithms are appealing as
they provide optimality guarantees against the optimal offline
solution. In practice, however, future input, e.g., wind generation,
is often predictable within a limited time window, and can be
readily exploited to further improve the competitiveness of online
algorithms. In this work, we exploit the structure of information
in the prediction window to design a novel prediction-aware
online algorithm for energy generation scheduling in microgrids.
Our algorithm achieves the best competitive ratio to date for
this important problem, which is at most 3Â´2{p1`Opw
qq where w is the prediction window size. We also characterize a nontrivial lower bound of the competitive ratio and show that the
competitive ratio of our algorithm is only 9% away from the lower
bound, when a few hours of prediction is available. Simulation
results based on real-world traces corroborate our theoretical
analysis and highlight the advantage of our new prediction-aware
design.</p>
