<h1>Prediction-Aware Competitive Online Algorithm Design in Presence of the Interval Prediction</h1>
<div id="subtitle">Joint work with <a href="http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/mchen88/index.html">Prof. Minghua Chen</a> from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/sid-chau">Prof. Sid Chi-Kin Chau</a> from The Australian National University. </div>

<li><p>  We study the microgrid energy generation scheduling problem with prediction of the near future input. Our goal is to schedule various energy sources in order to minimize the operational cost while satisfying both electricity and heat demand. However, due to uncertainty in the system inputs, including microgrid and renewable generation, designing a scheduling strategy for the problem is substantially different from those of conventional power systems. In the literature, a deterministic online algorithm called CHASE has been proposed to solve this problem. This algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of 3, which is the best possible among deterministic algorithms. Furthermore, this algorithm is extended to utilize the accurate prediction of the near future demand, which improves the competitive ratio of the algorithm. In this work, by exploiting the structure of the information we design a new prediction-aware online algorithm
that utilizes interval prediction, i.e., considering an interval of valid ranges for future data. This new algorithm properly takes the uncertainties involved in the future
information into account and it is the first algorithm to achieve a better competitive ratio compared to the prediction-oblivious algorithm.</p>
